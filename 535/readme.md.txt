### Installing

Download data form https://www.kaggle.com/c/rob535-fall-2019-task-1-image-classification/data

### Task 1
Step one
Use classify.py in folder 'step 1' to train mrcnn model. The weight will be saved in the same dir. 
Use crop.py in folder'step 1' and the weight generated by classify.py to crop test images. New image will be saved in folder named 'car' and a csv file will also be generated. 

Step two
Use testing.py in folder 'step 2' to label all new images and generate label csv file.
Combine the csv file gerated from step 1 and step 2 to create the final submission file. 

## Task 2 

Run task2.py with weight generated from Task 1 of mrcnn model to generate task2 csv file for submission.
